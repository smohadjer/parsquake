	<h1>Want to help us out?</h1>
	<p>We are dedicating our efforts to developing, implementing, improving, and distributing earthquake education packages all around Central Asia, particularly Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Iran. First and foremost, we seek collaborators within Central Asia that can help us implement earthquake curricula with young people. This might include teachers, administrators, or parents that would like to receive earthquake education curricula training. Second, we seek collaborators that can help us to locate, acquire, and distribute raw materials used throughout the curricula. Finally, we seek international geohazards specialists and scientists operating in Central Asia who are willing to share their knowledge with young people in the course of their field studies in the region.</p>
