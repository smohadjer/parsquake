		<h2>Properties of Earth Materials</h2>
		<p>Rocks are forced to change shape at or near plate boundaries due to stress generated by plate motions. Their response to stress depends on the type of stress, the rate at which it is applied, the environmental conditions of the rocks, and their composition. In this lesson, students use materials such as small metal springs, rubber bands, silly putty, and tootsie rolls to learn how and why rocks deform, and how this deformation is related to occurrence of earthquakes.</p>
